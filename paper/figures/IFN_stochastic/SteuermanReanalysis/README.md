# Re-analysis of IFN+ cells from Steuerman et al (2018) mouse-flu single cell
[Steuerman et al (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.008) performed single-cell RNA-seq on cells from influenza-virus infected mice.

Here we re-analyze their dat to see how many cells are expressing IFN.

All of the analysis is performed by the Jupyter notebook [Steuerman_reanalysis.ipynb](Steuerman_reanalysis.ipynb), which also downloads the raw data and generates the results.
