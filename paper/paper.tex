\begin{abstract}
The outcome of viral infection is extremely heterogeneous at the cellular level, and many viruses trigger innate immunity in only a fraction of infected cells. 
Here we develop an approach to determine how the genetic variation inherent in viral populations contributes to this heterogeneity.
We simultaneously determine the cellular transcriptome and full sequences of all viral genes in hundreds of influenza-infected cells.
Infections that trigger immunity are associated with several features: absence of the gene encoding the virus's primary immune antagonist, internal deletions in viral polymerase genes, and point mutations in viral proteins involved in replication and nuclear export. 
However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by viruses with these genetic lesions, and sometimes occurs even in cells infected with fully wildtype virions.
Overall, our work shows that viral genetic variation substantially contributes to but does not fully explain heterogeneity in infection outcome and immune activation.

\subsection{A method to obtain the complete genotypes of the virions infecting single cells that do and do not express IFN}

Two challenges:

IFN expression is rare in infected cells (\FIG{IFNrare}).
Apparent in single-cell \textit{in vitro}~\citep{russell2018extreme}, single-cell \textit{in vivo}~\citep{steuerman2018dissection}, and reporter assays by others~\citep{killip2017single} and ourselves (\FIG{IFNrare}).

The Venn diagram shows data aggregated over all samples from \citet{russell2018extreme}.
{\bf (B)} Creation of an A549 reporter cell line to efficiently identify single cells expressing IFN.
The cells are engineered to contain an IFN promoter that drives expression of a fluorescent protein and cell-surface protein amenable to MACS (magnetic-activated cell sorting).
We created reporter cell lines with both type I (IFN-$\beta$) and type III (IFN-$\lambda$) promoters (\FIGDATA[IFNrare]{reporter_sequences}).
The reporters were efficiently activated when infected with a virus known to potently induce IFN (\FIGSUPP[IFNrare]{reporter_validation}).
Expression of type I and type III IFN is highly correlated in the reporter cell lines upon infection with influenza virus (\FIGSUPP[IFNrare]{type_I_vs_III}).

\figsupp[Validation of IFN reporter cell lines.]
{To validate the IFN reporter cell lines, they were infected at high MOI with the Cantell strain of Sendai virus, which strongly activates IFN expression~\citep{strahle2006sendai}.
Activation of the IFN reporter was then monitored by flow cytometry using the marker indicated at the bottom of each plot (either a fluorescent protein or antibody staining for the cell-surface LNGFR).
Sendai infection efficiently activated the IFN reporter in all cases, with the strongest signal for the IFN-$\lambda$ reporter driving ZsGreen.

\figsupp[Expression of type I and type III IFN are highly correlated in influenza-infected A549 cells.]
{A549 cells were dually transduced with the IFN-$\beta$ and IFN-$\lambda$ reporters driving expression of mCherry and ZsGreen, respectively.
The cells were then infected with two different stocks of ``wildtype'' WSN influenza, or stocks with a deletion in PB1 or stop codons in NS1 (described later in the paper).
After 13 hours, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
As shown in the FACS plots, expression of the IFN-$\beta$ and IFN-$\lambda$ reporters is highly correlated in all cases.}

\figsupp[Few cells express detectable IFN in the single-cell analysis influenza-infected mice by \citet{steuerman2018dissection}.]
{A re-analysis of the data from \citet{steuerman2018dissection}'s single-cell mRNA-sequencing of cells from influenza-infected mice shows that only 5 of 1220 virus-infected cells express \emph{detectable} type I or type III IFN transcripts \textit{in vivo}.
Specifically, we downloaded the data from \citet{steuerman2018dissection} and identified influenza-infected cells using calling criteria similar to those described in \citet{steuerman2018dissection}.
Here we show statistics for the cells from the influenza-infected wildtype C57BL/6J mice, which were collected at 48 hours (two replicates) or 72 hours (one replicate)---we do not show cells from the control mice.
As shown in the left-most panel, the sequencing depth of \citet{steuerman2018dissection} was quite low, with only $\sim$1,500 mRNA counts per cell on average (this is 10 to 15-fold lower than the sequencing depth in \citet{russell2018extreme} and the current study, respectively).
An important caveat is that this low sequencing depth could lead to a simple failure to detect IFN transcripts in some cells.
Nonetheless, there is detectable expression of key interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) mRNAs in the majority of infected cells (the middle panel shows the total counts of IFIT1, ISG15, CCL5, and Mx1).
However, only 5 of 1220 cells express any detectable type I (IFN-$\alpha$ and IFN-$\beta$) or type III (IFN-$\lambda$) mRNAs, and only at low levels.

All past single-cell transcriptomics of viral infected cells~\citep{russell2018extreme,zanini2018single,steuerman2018dissection,zanini2018virus} have focused on counting the number of viral transcripts rather than determining their full sequences.
We came up with a scheme to determine full genotypes of infecting viruses in IFN+ cells (\FIG{experiment}).

\caption{
Experimental overview.
{\bf (A)} Schematic of approach.
{\bf (B)} Number of cells for which transcriptomes were obtained.
Most transcriptomes are from human cells, but a few are from the uninfected canine cells spiked into the experiment as a control.
From the transcriptomes with both human and canine transcripts, we estimate~\citep{bloom2018estimating} that $\approx$11\% of the captured cells are actually multiplets in which more than one cell was captured in an emulsion. 
These cross-celltype multiplets are excluded from subsequent analyses.
{\bf (C)} The number of cellular and viral mRNAs detected for each cell is plotted as a point.
Green lines show the distribution of cellular mRNAs per cell, and the blue rug plot at the left of each panel shows the distribution of viral mRNAs per cell.
Cells outside the dashed magenta lines have unusually low or high amounts of cellular mRNA (possibly low-quality emulsions or multiplets), and are excluded from subsequent analyses.
{\bf (D)} Distribution across cells of the fraction of all mRNA derived from influenza.
Cells called as infected are in blue, while other cells are in green.
The inset shows the amount of viral mRNA among the human cells called as infected.
{\bf (E)} The number of influenza genes detected per infected cell, and the amount of viral mRNA in cells expressing each number of viral genes.
The majority of cells express all eight gene segments, but a substantial minority fail to express at least one gene.
\FIGSUPP[experiment]{frac_has_gene} shows the frequency that each viral gene is detected in infected cells.
{\bf (F)} Relative expression of viral genes among infected cells.
{\bf (G)} The number of cells infected with wildtype virus, synonymously barcoded virus, or both.
From the cells infected with both viral barcodes, we estimate~\citep{bloom2018estimating} that 63\% of infected cells are co-infected.
{\bf (H)} Fraction of cellular mRNA derived from type I or type III IFN across all cells, faceted by whether the cells are infected.
Cells to the left of the first dashed magenta line are classified as IFN-, and cells to the right of the second line are classified as IFN+.
We grouped type I and type III IFN together because their expression is highly correlated (\FIGSUPP[experiment]{type_I_III_correlation}).
Many cells that do not express IFN itself still express interferon-stimulated genes (\FIGSUPP[experiment]{ISG}).
}
\label{fig:experiment}

\figsupp[Fraction of infected cells that detectably express each influenza gene.]
{Bars show the fraction of infected cells that are called as expressing each viral gene.
The gray dashed line is at one (the fraction that would be observed if all viral genes are expressed in all infected cells).
Each viral gene is detected in $\approx$80-90\% of the infected cells, roughly in line with prior estimates~\citep{brooke2013most, heldt2015single, dou2017analysis, russell2018extreme}.
The exception is NP, which is detected in virtually all infected cells.
The much higher frequency of detecting NP could reflect a biological phenomenon, or it could be because cells lacking NP tend to have much lower viral gene expression overall and so are not reliably called as being infected in our experiments and analysis.}

Each point represents a single cell.
The plots are faceted by whether the cells are called as infected, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is shown.
Because type I and type III IFN expression are highly correlated, for the remainder of the paper we group them together and refer to their combined expression as the level of IFN.

\label{figsupp:type_I_III_correlation}

\figsupp[Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).]
{
For each cell, we quantified ISG expression as the total fraction of cellular mRNAs derived from four prototypical ISGs that are highly expressed A549 cells (IFIT1, ISG15, CCL5, and Mx1). 
{\bf (A)} The histograms show the distribution of ISG expression taken across infected (top) and uninfected (bottom) cells.
We heuristically classify as ISG+ cells with $>10^{-3}$ of their cellular mRNA from ISGs, and color these cells red.
Comparison to \FIG{experiment}H shows that substantially more cells are ISG+ than IFN+, both among infected and uninfected cells.
This is probably because paracrine signaling leads to ISG expression in some cells that are not themselves expressing IFN.
{\bf (B)} The correlation between the fraction of cellular mRNA derived from IFN and from ISGs.
Each point represents a single cell, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is shown.
IFN and ISG expression is more correlated for infected than uninfected cells, probably because in the latter the ISG expression is often due to paracrine signaling that does not induce expression of IFN itself.
But among both the infected and uninfected populations, there are many cells with high expression of ISGs and little expression of IFN, but very few cells that express high levels of IFN without also substantially expressing ISGs.

\figsupp[Unsupervised t-SNE clustering shows that cell-to-cell variation in influenza genes, IFN genes, and ISGs explains a substantial part of the structure of the data.]
{To generate an unbiased representation of the factors that distinguished the transcriptomes of the cells in our experiments, we used unsupervised t-SNE~\citep{maaten2008visualizing} as implemented in \texttt{Monocle}~\citep{qiu2017reversed, trapnell2014dynamics} to generate a two-dimensional representation of the data.
In the t-SNE plot, each point is a different cell and cells with similar transcriptomes are closer together.
Each panel shows the same t-SNE plot, but the cells are colored differently in each panel based on the amount of viral, IFN, or ISG mRNA shown on a log (top) or linear (bottom) scale.
As is clear from this plot, expression of influenza genes, IFN, and ISGs help explain the structure of the data, since cells with high expression of these genes clearly group together.

\figsupp[Strategy for detecting strand exchange during sequencing of full-length viral genes.]
{The library preparation for PacBio sequencing of the cDNA for the full-length viral genes requires many cycles of PCR in order to produce a sufficient amount of DNA for sequencing.
A major concern is whether strand exchange during this PCR could scramble mutations and 10X cell barcodes / UMIs from different molecules.
We can detect PCR strand exchange by leveraging the fact that our cells were infected with a mix of wildtype virus and virus carrying synonymous barcodes near both termini of each gene.
If there is no strand exchange, all molecules should either be wildtype or have the synonymous mutations at the viral barcode sites.
But strand exchange will create some molecules that have a mix of wildtype nucleotides in the viral barcode at one termini and synonymous mutations in the viral barcode at the other termini.
\FIGSUPP[genotypes]{CCSs} shows the frequencies with which these different types of molecules were observed during the PacBio sequencing.
Note that since the rate of homologous recombination in influenza virus in negligible~\citep{boni2008homologous}, such mixed-barcode molecules are \emph{not} expected to be generated naturally during co-infection.
}
{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/StrandExchangeSchematic/StrandExchangeSchematic.pdf}}
\label{figsupp:StrandExchange}

\figsupp[Number of PacBio circular consensus sequences and PCR strand exchange rate.]
{
The number of PacBio CCSs that passed quality-control steps and aligned to an influenza virus gene.
Note that these sequences were obtained using several PacBio runs, some of which were loaded with different amounts of the various viral genes in order to increase coverage on genes that were needed in order to obtain the full sequences of virions infecting cells.
Therefore, unlike the 10X transcript count data in \FIG{experiment}H, the numbers of CCSs for different genes should \emph{not} be taken as an indicator of their abundance in the infected cells.
Especially for the polymerase genes (PB2, PB1, and PA), many of the CCSs corresponded to genes with internal deletions, since these shorter forms of the genes were presumably preferentially amplified during PCR.
Therefore, the plot is faceted by the number of CCSs for any length of the gene, and for full-length genes.
Note that the disproportionate sequencing of the shorter internally deleted genes should not greatly affect the genotype calling in \FIG{genotypes} since UMIs were used to collapse duplicate sequences for the same gene, and cell barcodes to collapse duplicate sequences from the same cell.
The bars are colored by whether the sequence can be identified as being derived from the wildtype viral variant, the synonymously barcoded variant, or represents a mixed barcode molecule (see \FIGSUPP[genotypes]{StrandExchange}).
From the frequencies of these different forms, we estimate~\citep{bloom2018estimating} that 5.7\% of molecules are chimeric due to PCR strand exchange.
Note that about half of these PCR chimeras could be identified by the presence of mixed viral barcodes and removed from subsequent analyses, leaving $\sim$3\% un-identified chimeras.
Note also that for some molecules (mostly polymerase genes with internal deletions) one of the barcode sites was deleted from the molecule and so the barcode identity could only be partially called.
A negligible number of molecules have low-accuracy sequence or unexpected nucleotide identities at the sites of the viral barcode.
}
{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/pacbio_single_cell_figures/ccs_per_viralbarcode.pdf}}
\label{figsupp:CCSs}

\figsupp[Number of cells for which genotype(s) of infecting viruses were completely determined.]
{Cells for which we could determine the full sequences of all genes expressed by the infecting virus(es).
{\bf (A)} We could call the complete genotypes of the infecting virus(es) for the majority of cells infected with just a single viral barcode variant, but only a minority of cells co-infected with both viral barcodes.
{\bf (B)} The cells for which we could call complete viral genotypes tended to have higher expression of viral mRNAs than cells for which we could not call complete genotypes.
This makes sense, as cells with more viral mRNA are more likely to have their viral genes captured in the PacBio sequencing, which is only able to capture a small fraction of the total transcripts identified by the 3'-sequencing of the 10X platform.
The lower calling rate for dual-barcode co-infections relative to single barcode infectionis is probably because these co-infections have more viral genes that must be sequenced (potentially a copy of each viral gene from each viral variant), increasing the chances that one of these genes is missed by the PacBio sequencing. 
An important implication of this plot is that the cells for which we call complete viral genotypes are \emph{not} a random subsampling of all infected cells in the experiment, but are rather enriched for cells that have high levels of viral mRNA and do not have dual-barcode viral infections.
Note also that this plot is limited to the cells that were called as infected (\FIG{experiment}D) and could clearly be classified as IFN- or IFN+ (\FIG{experiment}H).

Viral genetic variation partially explains the heterogeneity in viral burden and IFN induction among the infected cells for which we sequenced all expressed viral genes (\FIG{genotypes}).
{\bf (A)} 
The percent of all mRNA derived from virus, faceted by whether the cells express wildtype copies of all eight viral genes, or fail to express a wildtype copy of one or more genes (due to gene absence, amino-acid substitution, insertion, or deletion).
Cells infected by full wildtype virus exhibit less heterogeneity in viral burden as quantified by the Gini index (95\% confidence intervals are indicated).
{\bf (B)}
There is a trend for cells infected by full wildtype virus to express less IFN.
{\bf (C)}
Some specific forms of viral genetic variation are associated with IFN induction.
The top panel show the percent of IFN+ and IFN- cells that fail to express each viral gene.
The middle and bottom panels show the percent of IFN- and IFN+ cells that have a deletion or amino-acid substitution in each viral gene, conditioned on the cell expressing that gene.
Numbers above the bars give P-values (Fisher's exact test) and associated Q-values~\citep{storey2003statistical} for rejecting the null hypothesis that percents are equal among IFN- and IFN+ cells. 
Absence of NS is strongly associated with IFN induction, and amino-acid substitutions in PB1 or NS and deletions in HA are weakly associated with IFN induction.
Only the absence of NS remains significant at a false-discovery rate of 10\%.
\FIGSUPP[mutations]{allcells} shows that the trends remain largely the same if we also analyze infected cells with incomplete viral sequence information, with the addition of a trend towards IFN induction associated with \emph{presence} of PB2 and PA. 
\FIGSUPP[mutations]{isg} shows that the trends also remain largely similar if we analyze the association of viral genetic variation with ISG expression rather than IFN expression.
Insertions are not shown as a mutation type as they are extremely rare (\FIG{genotypes}).
{\bf (D)}
There is no association between IFN induction and the amount of viral mRNA in cells that express NS, but viral burden is associated with IFN induction among cells that lack NS.

For incompletely sequenced cells, deletions and substitutions are included in the counts when that particular viral gene is sequenced.
The major trends in \FIG{mutations}C are also true for the larger dataset in this figure.
In addition, there is now a modest trend for infected cells that fail to express PB2 and PA \emph{not} to express IFN.

The major viral features that associate with IFN induction also associate with ISG expression.
Specifically, cells that express wildtype copies of all eight viral genes tend to express ISGs less frequently and at lower levels
